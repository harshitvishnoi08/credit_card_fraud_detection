Project Title
Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. By analyzing transaction data, the project identifies patterns and anomalies associated with fraudulent activity.

Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables related to transactions.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the dataset.
Data preprocessing, including handling class imbalance using oversampling techniques like SMOTE.
Implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
Tools and Technologies
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Results
Achieved [specific results, e.g., 95% precision and 92% recall on the test set].
