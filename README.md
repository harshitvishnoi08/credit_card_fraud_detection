# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It contains anonymized transaction data with features such as transaction time, amount, and engineered variables.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding patterns in the dataset and visualizing class distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Addressed class imbalance using oversampling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- **Modeling:** Implemented machine learning algorithms including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Evaluation:** Assessed models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

## Results

Achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions with the following metrics:
- **Precision:** [Specify value, e.g., 95%]
- **Recall:** [Specify value, e.g., 92%]
- **F1-Score:** [Specify value]

## How to Use
